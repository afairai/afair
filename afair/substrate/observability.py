"""Observability snapshots — the expectation-checker's counters overlay.

The cold-path :class:`~afair.agents.expectation_checker.ExpectationChecker`
appends one row per cycle summarising pipeline health as pure integer
counts (stuck extractions, retry-exhausted events, permanent failures,
…). ``/health`` reads only the latest row — a single indexed ``LIMIT 1``
lookup — so the window-function aggregates that produce the counts never
run on Fly's ~30s health probe.

Invariant fit:

  - **Operational telemetry, not user memory (ADR-0005).** Like
    ``pipeline_events``, this table is the pipeline's flight recorder — never
    recalled, prunable past a retention window. It is NON-substrate: no
    append-only triggers, and the Pruner ages old rows out. I2 protects the
    user's memory, not the instrumentation about how the plumbing ran.
    :func:`write_snapshot` still only ever INSERTs.
  - **Counts only.** :func:`write_snapshot` rejects any counter value that
    is not ``int | None`` (raises ``ValueError``). This is the code-level
    guarantee that no content, entity name, error string, or filesystem
    path can ever reach the unauthenticated ``/health`` body through a
    snapshot.
